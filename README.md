### Music To Me

## Project
I will have a backend written in Javascript, with Elysia as the Http Framework
At the frontend, React Native (Expo) Will be used to create a universal app on the web and mobile
Overall, what should happen is the user searches for their song, the frontend will then make a request to the backend with the name. The backend will go through youtube's search API and return a list of the songs. The user chooses one, and the frontend creates an embeded player. 
In order to make a playlist, their will be a json text stored on the users device, which will have the link, thumbnail, order and other details of the songs in the playlist.
